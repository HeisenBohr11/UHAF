The Universal Health Access Foundation (**UHAF**) is a non profit organization which is dedicated to providing care to those who require it. We beleive that each and every person should have food, water, shelter, and medical care. Our mission is to make sure that we are able to help those we can and start a movement which will improve the lifestyle of many people. I created this initiative as a way to bring awareness and help people who are having trouble trying to get their basic human needs. Currently, we are raising funds for two free medical camps in the state of Rajasthan. Our goal is to collect $900 to provide the patients who come with a checkup, diagnosis, treatment, as well as transportation and snacks. Together, all of us canmake a difference and bring positive impacts in people's lives. Join me in my quest to make sure each person gets the resources they need to live a happy, healthy, and safe life.
