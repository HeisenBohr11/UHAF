The Universal Health Access Foundation (**UHAF**) is a non profit organization which is dedicated to providing care to those who require it. We beleive that each and every person should have food, water, shelter, and medical care. Our mission is to make sure that we are able to help those we can and start a movement which will improve the lifestyle of many people. 

I created this initiative as a way to bring awareness and help people who are having trouble trying to get their basic human needs. You can read more about this and me [**here**]({{ site.baseurl }}/about).

I need your help and support to make a difference and bring positive impact to people's lives. [**JOIN ME**]({{ site.baseurl }}/support) in my quest to make healthcare available and accessible to everyone, with this ancient Sanskrit mantra serving as our guiding light:  

*sarve bhavantu sukhinaḥ  
sarve santu nirāmayāḥ  
sarve bhadrāṇi paśyantu   
mā kaścidduḥ khabhāgbhaveta।  
śāntiḥ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ॥*  

**English Translation:**  
*May all sentient beings be at peace,  
may no one suffer from illness,  
May all see what is auspicious,   
may no one suffer.  
Om peace, peace, peace.*
