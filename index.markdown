The Universal Health Access Foundation (**UHAF**) is a non profit organization which is dedicated to bring healthcare to impoverished communities. As a group we have planned to host events which will improve people's lives for the better. Alongside a team of doctors, we provide free medical checkups at the camps we host. The doctors perform the checkups and provide diagnosis as well as needed medicine. This ensures that each patient has the tools they need for a full recovery.
