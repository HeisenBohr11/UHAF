  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>My name is Neelansh Bhandari, and I am currently a rising freshman at Skyline High School in Sammamish, Washington. My passion for medicine drives my ambition to become a neurosurgeon.</p>

<p>During my time at Beaver Lake Middle School, I founded and captained the Science Bowl team, leading us to 3 wins out of 4. Additionally, I established the Science Olympiad Club and served as its founder, while achieving significant success with two awards at the State Competition. I also founded and currently serve as president of our school's math club.
</p>

<p>Active in my community, I am a member of the National Junior Honor Society (NJHS) and contribute to my school's robotics club by teaching coding. In addition to my academic pursuits, I hold a gray belt in Jiu Jitsu and enjoy competing regularly. As a Boy Scout, I find great joy in camping and hiking. I am also fluent in 3 languages, English, French, and Hindi. Alongside that, I have a working knowledge of Spanish.</p>

<p>In my leisure time, I am an avid cricket player and devote time to reading and watching movies. To unwind, I practice my guitar and piano, play board games with my family, and hang out with my friends.</p>

<p>During my time in India, I noticed a lot of poverty and people living in unfathomable conditions. Those people were unable to afford medical care and that is the reason why I created this organization. Due to this, I hope many people will be able to access the health resources they require.
