Jodhpur, with its iconic blue-painted houses and a legacy rich in culture and history, is a city brimming with life and stories. Yet, like many places, it faces challenges, and one of these which is the most pressing is having access to affordable healthcare. To help address this, I partnered with **Dr. Siddharth Lodha, Dr. Sangeeta Lodha, Soul Foundation, and Kings Hospital to organize a medical camp on December 22, 2024**. The camp aimed to provide checkups, diagnoses, and essential medications, at no costs, and to as many people as possible, ensuring that quality care reached those in need.

The camp was a resounding success, with 136 patients benefiting from the initiative. Over 130 patients were tested for diabetes, 74 underwent ECG tests, 120 had bone density tests, and 87 received lung function tests using PFT machines. The camp brought together an incredible team of medical professionals, including Dr. Sunil Arora, the ASGI Hospital eye care team, and experts from Vyas Dental Medical College, who conducted thorough dental checkups. Dietitian Jyoti Gehlot and Dr. Ajay Trivedi also offered their invaluable services, providing tailored advice and care for patients.

Among the patients was **Pankaj Jain**, a 49-year-old resident of Jodhpur living with diabetes for two years. The camp gave him access to a comprehensive health check, during which he discovered other underlying issues he hadn’t been aware of. The relief on his face was evident as he shared how much the initiative meant to him, allowing him to prioritize his health and use his limited resources to invest in his family’s future.

Another inspiring story was that of **Dheerendra Singh**, a 60-year-old retired army officer working as a bank security guard. With retirement approaching, he aspires of becoming a driver to supplement his income. At the camp, he received a full health checkup, which gave him peace of mind about his condition. Touched by the impact of the camp, Dheerendra offered to assist with transportation arrangements for future camps once his driving business is operational.

This event wouldn’t have been possible without the unwavering dedication of the doctors, staff, and volunteers. Their efforts ensured that every patient received compassionate care in a well-coordinated setup.

While the camp, as well as the one in [**Barmer**]({{ site.baseurl }}/jekyll/update/2024/12/15/Barmer.html), ran smoothly, they also provided important learnings. To meet the growing demand, I plan to start campaigns earlier and raise more funds, as the goal for both camps was **$900** but we could only collect **$510**. Thankfully, the support of Lion's Club, Maheshwari Samajh, Soul Foundation and other generous contributors made these initiatives a reality.

While these camps were in India, it is important to realize that other countries are also impacted by healthcare crisis. Due to this, I am looking for more volunteers of different origins who can aid in bringing healthcare all over the world. Please email me at **uhaf24@gmail.com** for more details.

As we move forward, I’m deeply grateful for everyone who contributed to this mission, and I’m inspired to continue making a difference. Together, we can build healthier, more compassionate communities, one step at a time.
