<p>Jodhpur is a beautiful city in the heart of Rajasthan. Its named the blue city due to its rich and vibrant blue hues painted all over houses. This look makes it one of the of the world's most unique citites. The food in Jodhpur is known all over the world, and its history is mesmerizing to learn. However, like in all cities across the world, Jodhpur has a lot of homelessness. This is why, I am partnering with Dr. Siddharth Lodha at Kings Hospital in Jodhpur to make medicine and doctors accessible to all. We will provide checkups, diagnosis, and required drugs for all who come. Even a donation as little as $5 dollars could make a difference in people's lives.</p>

**Contact me at *uhaf24@gmail.com* to donate towards this cause and let me know how you heard about this initiative.**  
I am yet to register as 501 (c)(3) and set up a proper donation page.  
At present, I am only accepting contributions from friends, family and acquaintances, with a limit of $50 per contribution.
