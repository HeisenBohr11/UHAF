Jodhpur is a city with over 11,000 people who are homeless. These people do not have access to medical care and are unable to get checkups. This is why we are partnering with King's Hospital to provide the best care care possible for the city of Jodhpur. We are running this alongside Dr. (Sidd dadu full name). This initiative will impact many peoples lives and can help in saving their lives
