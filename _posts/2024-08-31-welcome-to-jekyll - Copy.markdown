<p>Along the western border of India lies Rajasthan. Rajasthan is a massive state where most of the land is a desert. But on this dry expanse, the natives have created a mystical culture, amazing folklore, and lots of delicious food. And on the western most end, lies the city of Barmer. This city is where my father had grown up and I have been there many times. The locals are incredibly nice. However, near Barmer, there are a few incredible small villages who are not as privelaged as us and are miles away from healthcare facility. Due to this reason, I wanted to help them out and provide them with the medical care the require. To mkae this dream come true, I am asking you to pitch in and donate to make a change in people's lives.</p>

**Contact me at *uhaf24@gmail.com* to donate towards this cause and let me know how you heard about this initiative.**
