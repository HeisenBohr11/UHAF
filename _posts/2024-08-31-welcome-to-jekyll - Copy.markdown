Along the western border of India lie many villages. These villages are stricken with poverty and are in a rough condition. The villagers are far away from medical care and cannot afford to have yearly checkups. To help them, I am hosting a medical camp with a team of passionate doctors to provide diagnosis and orovide the villagers with the medicine they require.
