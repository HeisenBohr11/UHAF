<p>Along the western border of India lies Rajasthan. Rajasthan is a massive state where most of the land is a desert. But on this dry expanse, the incredible natives have created a mystical culture, spectacular folklore, and delicious cuisines. And on the western most end of this western state, lies the city of Barmer. This city is where my father grew up and I have visited it many times. However, near Barmer, there are  many small villages and hamlets, where people have more limited means and are miles away from quality healthcare facilities. I wanted to be able to play a tiny part in improving the quality of life of people living in these remote parts, and I decided to host a medical camp in the village of Gadra Road (highlighted in the map below) by bringing a team of experienced medical professionals and free medicines. Many generous souls came forward by donating for the cause which helped cover the expenses. On site, I teamed up with the local chapter of the amazing Lion's Club, and the Maheshwari Samaj, who kindly provided us with their community's premises and made other arrangements such as food for the visiting doctors. Together, we were able to provide quality medical care to the people in and around this village. I would like thank the doctors who carved out time from their busy schedules; Dr. R. K. Maheshwari (pediatrician), Dr. Mohit Maheshwari (orthopedic), Dr. S. R. Bhandari (General Practioner), Dr. M. L. Khatri (Pathologist), Dr. Vandana Jain (Gynaecologist), and Dr. Gurdeep Charan (Dentist). There are many others such as Mr. Jitendra Sukhani (logistics), Mr. Om Prakash (photographt), and _____ who made this event possible.</p>

Overall, this camp (pictures below) benefited more than 250 people who needed medical care but were unable to access it for various personal, logistical or financial reasons. Jaswadan, a 78-year old man, is one of these beneficaries. He lives in one of the small villages near Gadra. He and his entire family (wife, 2 children + their spouces, and 4 grandchildren) are supported by his son who is a construction laborer. Due to this, he is unable to afford the 100 rupee bus ride to the city of Barmer, where high quality medical care is available. He says that he is thankful for the medical camp as his neck has been paining severely for over 3 months and he coughs a lot at night and has trouble sleeping. Thanks to the camp we were able to provide medicine and care for Jaswadan.

**Himanshu:** Himanshu is a 15 year old boy who has lived his entire life in Gadra. He has bee having severe headaches continuously over the course of 2 months and has gone to the local hospitals but could not get cured. He is relativly well off, and can go to bigger cities, like Barmer or Jodhpur, but only goes when his pain becomes unbearable. Due to the medicine and experise of doctors we were able to help him.
