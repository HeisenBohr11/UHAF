You’ll **find this** TEST post in your `_posts` directory. *Go TEST ahead and edit it* and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

1. Hello
1. World
1. How are you?

Trying to add a [LINK](https://www.espn.com), let's see if it works.

Now adding a local link to another page on the same site [LINK](welcome-to-jekyll.html), let's see if it works.

Link to about page on the same site [LINK](\UHAF/about/), let's see if it works.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

![Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/IMG_1.jpg)

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
